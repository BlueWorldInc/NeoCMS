NEO CMS

(Same content as mainBook.txt)

The objectif of NEO CMS is to make a CMS (Content Management System), a "clone" of Wordpress in a way. It need to include core feature of Wordpress.
The main feature that need to be included in order to consider this project successfull while be listed below.
The language which will be used for the front end is Javascript (of course), for the "back end", it will be either Javascript, PHP, C# or Java (or even Python but highly unlikely). Or even a mix of few languages. I will make a small part about the benefit (for me) of using one over an other later in this document.
To be considered finished this project don't need polishing. The reason is that, well for a personal project, i'm not that motivated, and i don't have the drive to make the polishing. It's kinda boring and "long" and more importantly I know I will add more and more "things" to the project in order to considered it polished enough, and it will probably never be good enough, because I will be judge and the party. So without external constraint (to finish the project) the project will probably be unfinished and thus I will be unsatisfied. I prefer to make a functional but not polished project that I consider finished over a one that is better but that I don't consider finished, at least for a personal project.
A gross estimate of the time I need to make it is 6 month with 1 hour a week.

So the first feature that need to be implemented (I will make a list of those later) is form validation, with first front end validation and second back end validation. Then a login system. 
Later on I will need to include Authentification and Authorisation system.
A cool but not core feature that will be cool to add will be the possibility to add template directly from Wordpress Templte. To a lesser degree maybe adding the possibility to add HTML template directly (that's will be cool too).
Another cool thing (but that start to become an other project) will be to make a WYSIWYG editor (at least a basic one) in the CMS panel. For this I will probably need to see what other project have done it, because the "look and feel" is really important in this one. Did they use canvas ? (seems unlikly but a possibility definitively). What they used to make it feel "right" ?.

Feature that need to be included:

-Form validation: front.

-Form validation: back.

-Login system with password (hash (md5?) and salt).

-Authentifiaction system.

-Authorisation system.

-Making a page where we can create post. (just writing texte and posting it).

-Making the editor to create the post to edit the style of the text.

-Possibility to modify the text.

-Making possibility to add commentary.

-An admin panel which can edit the contents.

-Which can change "right of users".

-A statistics page, which show user statistique like which page is visited.

-Advanced (thus don't need to be included to be accepted as finished):

	-A payment system (linked to something like Stripe).
	
	-Possibility to integrate wordpress template.
	
	-A WYSIWIG editor.

-A page for choosing template (pre-made simple template, made by myself).
